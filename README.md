# Genetic-Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm is based on Darwin's theory of natural selection and evolution.
There are 5 phases in a genetic evolution:
1. Initialising the population
2. Calculating fitness of each individual/chromosome
3. Selection
4. Crossing Over
5. Mutation

All these phases of genetic evolution are demonstrated for 10 generations where the population of a generation is the set of 6 chromosomes with a genome size of 5. Here, the (natural) selection is done using tournament selection.
All indiviuals/chromosomes reproduce to generate offsprings which have a higher fitness.
